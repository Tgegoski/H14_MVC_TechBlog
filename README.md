# H14_MVC_TechBlog

Writing about tech is a very important part of the web development world. Developers spend a lot of time reading documentation for applications or packages that they need for their projects. Many developers also rely on community blog sites help to explain issues that a developer may be experiencing or help them learn a new form of coding. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

Your task this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
